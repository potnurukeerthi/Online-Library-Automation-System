📚 Library Automation System
The Library Automation System is a web-based application developed using the Django framework to streamline and digitize the day-to-day operations of a library. It aims to eliminate manual processes by automating tasks such as book management, user registration, book issuance, and returns. The system provides role-based access for both students and administrators, ensuring secure and organized handling of library resources. Students can easily search for books, view availability, and track issued items, while administrators can manage the inventory, monitor transactions, and maintain records through an intuitive dashboard. This project enhances efficiency, reduces human error, and offers a reliable and scalable solution for modern library management.
